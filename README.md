# Chess ♟️
This is a fully-working chess game, implemented in python with the Qt library for GUI elements. I programmed the chess board and each chess piece in separate classes. Each piece contains a method to generate a list of possible moves and attacks during each round. The pieces are tracked using a 2D array, and some functions to manage the GUI.
